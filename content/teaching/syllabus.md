The philosophy behind these lectures is to encourage self-study and to not expect spoon-feeding, as this is the only approach that will benefit in the long run. The syllabus is designed in such a way, as to encourage exploration of the subject. Topics will be covered in detail and the emphasis would be placed on the concepts. While problem solving is an important aspect of math and physics, it is something that must be learned on your own by solving a ton of problems. Lectures are meant to compliment the reccomended textbooks and do not serve as a substitute, rather are meant to clear the concepts and help you to understand how things are connected in the bigger picture. This approach will be taken with physics as well, where we will see how many fundamental questions can be solved simply using various mathematical tools that are developed. Instead of treating mathematics and physics as being different subjects, we shall see how they are related and often motivate the growth in each other.

Topics that are included in the syllabus cover both 11-12th math and physics and at times go little outside the confines of syllabus to ensure better exposition of ideas. We will also place emphasis on reasoning and proofs instead of just memorising formulas and solving problems as is often done in schools. The detailed syllabus is as following,
