Darkness - its a funny thing. There’s no light, yet there’s so much to see. Perhaps more to see than light ever allows us to. It is really the lack of the warmth that shows the hearth that the human company is. Being all alone, staring at the ceiling, how many more nights like this ? One more I say to myself, as I drift off in my thoughts — I have plenty of them. Perhaps more than there are stars in this world. Each thought living a life of its own, walking on its own self righteous path. There’s no saying where I am going to go now, but the thought leads the way. It isn’t like I have any control, no, it is all an illusion. My thoughts control me. They control this world. Every moment is a mystery, abundant with possibilities; it’s just a matter of which one I think I am choosing. Is it going to be that paralyzing fear today ? Or am I visiting the Kingdom of Narcissus ? Am I going to drown in the deep ocean of my sorrows, or am I going to conquer the stars ? 

Funny isn’t it ? How the darkness shows us more possibilities than light ever did ? Perhaps some stern cold was we needed in life — the loneliness, the agonizing self hatred, the fire that burns your soul to ashes, the voice of your heart beating echoing through your body — when you experience that, that’s when you know the darkness has gifted its essence to you. What you endure is not even a fraction of horror that it has to offer. Yet with great pain must come great reward. To know that the world is cruel unjust place, where people would care more about what is not in their hands, than you — that understanding is what you are gifted. What a blessing it is! What a wonderful gift it is! 

When all the good things begin to hurt you, but the sadness feels like home, that’s how you know the darkness is getting to you. Not to worry, it’s nothing to fear! It is harmless I swear. A few cuts maybe here and there, a few fires burning on my skin — may sound horrible, but it is nothing compared to the flame that burns your heart. You come out stronger in the end. Is what they all say. Did I really come out stronger or the weak ones just didn’t make it through ? 

I think about it a lot. I am quite fond of it actually nowadays. I used to fear it in the beginning, but now — its like a home, a home I never had. One where I am in pain all the time, yet so comfortable that I cannot even move. Petrified by my own brain. By my own thoughts. Somehow tricked into this masochism, eager for more. More pain, more suffering! That is all I wish for. This is my new religion. The darkness has liberated me. Showed me what it is that truly matters. 

I am nobody in this world. I tried going in the light, only to have my heart burn and eyes water. The darkness is where my home lies. It is time I accept it. It is time I fly into the night, embracing it for what it really is — the beautiful monstrous sadistic creature, a brainchild of mine. Oh, what a parent would I be, if I didn’t love a child of mine ? It has spawned from me. I like to think it consumed me, but perhaps, I consumed this world. I infected it with this disease. No, not a disease, a blessing — true enlightenment only comes via the path of suffering. Which raises the question, is it really worth it ? 

The darkness demands that you believe so. I demand that I believe so. For I have become this darkness. I am no longer its essence but it of mine. Will it always be this cold in here ? Or will the hearth of some company bring me some warmth ? What a blasphemous thought! How could it be ? I am superior, the one true sufferer. I belong with no one. No, no one belongs with me. For them to think they understand the sacred words of this darkness ? Laughable. Utterly hilarious. You do not understand anything, you think you see the world, but you do so by shining your light — if you want to see the world for what it really is, join me, join me in the dark, far from the warmth and the sun, sacrifice your heart, your soul, make your mind a part of mine. We are one, we are the One. The true sufferers, agonized by every breath we take. 

How foolish of me to offer you such solitude! You could never appreciate it. You do not deserve it. Me ? I do. For reasons that I am unaware. I am the sole bearer of the truth of this world. The real darkness — it is only visible to me. I am the priest, I am the follower, I am the God, I am the blasphemer. It is just me. No one else. Just me and my essence — the darkness.
