My name is Srinidhi Kabra, and currently I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali. I am a mathematics major with a deep interest in understanding the interaction between pure math and science, mainly, physics.\nI am passionately curious about the world around me. I try to understand the nuanced beauty this universe has to offer through the lens of pure math and physics. I am mainly interested in exploring the intersection(s) of geometry, algebra, topology and physics. I am also incredibly fascinated by mathematical biology, evolutionary game theory in particular.\nOther than academics, I love to cook, write, paint and swim. I love solving sudokus, especially different variants; and reading books in my free time. I am passionate not just about leanring mathematics but also math exposition, as such, I also teach in my free time. I am trying to compile a set of notes which are dedicated towards motivating concepts in undergraduate mathematics curriculum and presenting them in a manner that reconciles ituition with rigor.\nBrowse around the website to find out more about me and my projects!\n","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Srinidhi Kabra's Homepage","summary":"","title":"Srinidhi Kabra's Homepage","type":"page"},{"content":" In this essay, I want to ponder over ‘meaning’ in the setting of abstraction. It seems contradictory at first, isn’t abstraction the very process of stripping reality of its meaning? That maybe a question for another day, but no, that’s not my aim here. My aim is to understand on a surface level what it means to assign meaning to this abstraction.\nMathematics to me, is and forever will be a fantasy world to get lost in, much like a child creates his imaginary world and spends their day ruminating and fighting monsters. However, this imaginary world nuanced, one where we cannot just rewrite millennia of effort just based on a whim or a general dislike. It’s rules are well defined, often difficult to understand and even harder to internalise.\nOn the surface, it seems as if its just a bunch of definitions, followed by theorems and proofs. Much is to blame on mathematical exposition for this conceptualisation, but I must not digress. Even though it is simply a series of logical steps based off of previous results, there’s a richness that cannot quite be captured by words, yet anyone who enjoys mathematics is familiar with it. A mere symbolic manipulation doesn’t feel quite as thrilling as a proof which introduces new definitions and ideas. One can disregard this observation as simply a matter of preference, or one could ask, what makes them different? After all, both are just using well defined rules to manipulate statements and results to conclude new ones. From this perspective the proof of the first isomorphism theorem for groups isn’t much different than say, proving a certain identity involving binomial coefficients. One may argue that they differ in their applications, combinatorial identities may not be particularly useful however the importance of first isomorphism theorem is well accepted.\nI refuse to accept this as a valid reason. Surely, the problems we choose to solve determine what is of importance and what isn’t. However, historically, the problems have always been in some ways instructed by the human nature — in my view, it is a mere coincidence that we solve the problems that we do, for if we were different beings, perhaps we would have vastly different fields of pure mathematics which we would be interested in. If we consider the set of all results which can be derived from the ZFC axioms (we will assume them to be consistent), then it is natural to assume that the restriction of this set to something like calculus should be of equal magnitude as something much more “unimportant” as say, mathematical way of tying shoe laces. This is simply because one can always derive more results based off of the previous one. One can conceptualise a machine which just uses axioms and established results to produce new ones. What is to say one of these machines will stop before another? It is only a matter of human interest that we select one of these over the other. With this in mind, one is faced with the question once again — what makes one important and the other one, not so much?\nI will attempt to answer this question but first, I must take a small detour. Currently, I have been crediting a course called “Set Theory and Logic”. The instructor since the very beginning stressed the importance between semantics and syntactics. In the beginning this seemed like a pointless distinction, why does it even matter in the grand scheme of things? The subtlety of the definition was lost on me, until recently. What exactly is syntactics? It is the study of how we manipulate symbols, how we draw valid inferences, what makes a proof “correct”. Whereas semantics help us ascribe meaning to our ‘universe’ as we called it in class. Now, let us unpack what this means.\nConsider any book — preferably something which is typically considered as profound, say works of Dostoevsky or Camus. The beauty of these works do not lie simply in the way letters are arranged, but the way they speak to the reader and everyone is left with a different experience after reading the book. The author forces you to fight with your emotions, to introspect, to question. But at the end of the day, aren’t these just strings of letters? This is the difference between semantics and syntactics. Syntactics ensures that we have valid strings, whereas semantics helps us interpret it.\nSimple enough eh? What does this have to do with mathematics? Let us think back to our previous example, say we had a proof of the Riemann hypothesis and another proof which involves some standard symbolic manipulation and provides us with a new identity involving binomial coefficients. Without a doubt, everyone would find the proof of Riemann hypothesis to be far more interesting, presumably not just because it is unsolved for so long, but also because as the general expectation goes, it would introduce new concepts, new profound theorems and open up a new field of investigation, much like Wiles did with Fermat’s last theorem. But now consider the computers from before, they will see both these proofs as simply syntactical writings. To them, what should make one more interesting than the other?\nThe point I wish to highlight is that mathematics is incomplete without semantics. Any result is meaningless without its interpretation, or its contextualisation in the grand tapestry of human ambitions. There’s no inherent importance that any theorem carries, it is ascribed by us due to its ability to aid us in our goals. Much like how differential geometry was once irrelevant to physicists until they discovered that it could be used to understand the universe. Did the field change? Over time yes, but back then, it was the same to physicists and mathematicians alike. But the difference in their ambitions changed the importance of the same entity, which further proves how semantics has the power to shape our understanding and vision of the world. Without the motivation, without the grander picture in mind, why would we engage in Langland’s program? Why would we engage in a theory of quantum gravity? Isn’t it because we hope that it would solve our questions, satisfy our thirst? Inevitably, we end up contextualising the field in the tapestry of our ambitions. ambitions.\nMathematics is meaningless without the underlying motivation, the long term vision and the sight of the Great Ones, such as Grothendiek, Langland and many more, which paved the direction of exploration in this vast forest. While undoubtedly, syntactics is important, it is rendered meaningless without the interpretation. This strongly suggests the changes we need to make in our pedagogy, in mathematics exposition. Not to train computers who could write proofs but people who could interpret and ascribe meaning.\n","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/math/math-meaning/","section":"Maths","summary":"","title":"Syntactics vs Semantics of Mathematics","type":"math"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Assignments will include both relevant readings as well as problems from textbooks and the ones that I have designed.\n1.

I am a particularly expressive person, as such, sharing the joy I found in these subjects was simply a part of self expression for me. I have been keen about explaining concepts since a young age; teaching juniors, peers and at times even seniors.\nI have always been frustrated with the education system I was raised in. The emphasis was always on rote learning and obtaining marks, but never on understanding and appreciating the subject. This rat-race not only sucks the joy out of learning, but worse yet, it misrepresents STEM subjects as being highly technical, devoid of any beauty and allure. I wanted to make a change in this in any capacity I could, as such, I decided to start teaching, afterall, exposition has always been like a second langauge to me.\nThe goal with my teaching program was to find like minded students who are interested in understanding the subject itself, instead of just scoring good marks. I got in touch with some high school students who wanted to understand and appreciate mathematics and physics and after understanding their needs, I designed a syllabus suitable for their needs - both academic and intellectual. Since then, I have been teaching them the concepts of mathematics and physics in very much the same manner that I view them - not as formulas to be memorised, but as stories that weave together centuries of human curiosity, ambition, and ideas.\nOn this page you can find my most recent teaching activity with detailed syllabus, my reccomended resources and assigments I have designed.\n","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/teaching/","section":"Teaching Activities","summary":"","title":"Teaching Activities","type":"teaching"},{"content":" The philosophy behind these lectures is to encourage self-study and to not expect spoon-feeding, as this is the only approach that will benefit in the long run. The syllabus is designed in such a way, as to encourage exploration of the subject. Topics will be covered in detail and the emphasis would be placed on the concepts. While problem solving is an important aspect of math and physics, it is something that must be learned on your own by solving a ton of problems. Lectures are meant to compliment the reccomended textbooks and do not serve as a substitute, rather are meant to clear the concepts and help you to understand how things are connected in the bigger picture. This approach will be taken with physics as well, where we will see how many fundamental questions can be solved simply using various mathematical tools that are developed. Instead of treating mathematics and physics as being different subjects, we shall see how they are related and often motivate the growth in each other.\nTopics that are included in the syllabus cover both 11-12th math and physics and at times go little outside the confines of syllabus to ensure better exposition of ideas. We will also place emphasis on reasoning and proofs instead of just memorising formulas and solving problems as is often done in schools.

Usually when we discuss class, we do so in the context of socioeconomic hierarchy; in this essay, I want to take the abstract essence of the concept of a class, and use this abstraction to analyze a social conflict to get a solid understanding of what it means for something to be a class, to get understand how the concept of class helps us understand social conflicts. Another reason for choosing a rather unconventional process to elucidate the scope of this concept, is my own personal bias towards the intersection of science and social sciences; feminism and religion in particular.\nA society is comprised of its constituents, the people. Each of these individuals has their own unique identity, their own moral compass and held values, which are rarely disjoint. One observes that in the society there seems to exist a moral superiority - certain morals are deemed to be better than others. While moral superiority in the form “I am better than you because I do not kill people” is quite unsurprising, a less obvious example would be that of conflicting ideologies and religions; where even though numerous of the held values of shared, one perceives themselves as being superior to the other group purely by the virtue of belonging to their religion. An important distinction to be made between this moral conflict of two religions and socioeconomic hierarchy is that of acceptance of the hierarchy - socioeconomic hierarchy is universally accepted by all the constituents, there are no doubts that having more wealth puts you higher up on the ladder. However, in the case of this moral superiority there isn’t a universally accepted hierarchy, rather each side believes they are the superior ones. This gives rise to sharp divide in the society, as the primary point of contention is also the source of recognition, whereas in socioeconomic hierarchy the recognition is tied solely with wealth, the class struggle in this case is one to move up the ladder for higher recognition, and to fight against the oppression by the bourgeoisie. This stark difference between two religious groups permeates throughout the society, and even when the two groups have many similar values, one group is not willing to concede that to the other by fear of losing their supposed hierarchy and thus recognition.\nHaving set the domain in which we will be working - conflict based on moral hierarchy between religion A and B (which can be extended to religion and secular people) - I would now like to spend some time discussing the importance and the necessity of the definition of class, as well as explain what class really means. Let us consider the distribution of constituents between the two extremes of the population. We can observe that people aren’t uniformly dispersed between the two ends, the two ends being fundamentalist religion A and fundamentalist religion B; rather the distribution is denser along some point on this spectrum than others. While there is no denying that between any two points on this spectrum, there always is an individual lying between them; in practice this means that the conflict between religious ideologies ends up becoming the conflict between the people who adhere to one or the other. If the distribution was uniform between these two extremes, we would hardly see any serious conflicts; but due to this ‘clustering effect’ where some points on the spectrum are denser than others, the conflict becomes more apparent as the differences get larger between these two groups as the battle for recognition becomes increasingly tense. Thus, in practicality, the conflict plays itself not as a conflict between numerous individuals, rather a conflict between two players - the players being the ‘cluster’ formed by people.\nWhen analyzing any conflict, understanding the players themselves is an important part, as their differences give rise to the said conflict. The players play a central role in the conflict. As such it is only natural to start the study of these conflicts by understanding the structuring of these ‘clusters’. We refer to these ‘clusters’ formed due to social divisions as class. While players are an important aspect of any conflict, a conflict is not defined by just the players involved - we also need to understand the factors due to which conflict persists. In the Marxist theory, the driver of any conflict is the surplus of labor. As we shall see, in this example too, it is the surplus of labor that drives the conflict, however we surplus labor in a rather unconventional form.\nWhile I have spent a lot of time discussing the concept of a class, and highlighting the important points of it, I have barely given any physical processes in which we see these concepts take form. Just to summarize, concepts of social hierarchy and conflict are imperative to understanding class. In understanding conflict, we need to talk about the factors driving the conflict - surplus labor. In this essay I set up the stage to be a society which is divided into classes on the basis of religious ideology - for simplicity we shall consider conflict between secular group and a religiously conservative group. To take a real example, I would like to roll back time to 1960s United States, where Christianity is prevalent. Ideas pertaining to sex and sexualities are considered to be taboo and obscene. I would like to take the example of research done by William Masters and Virginia Johnson on human sexual activities. In particular their research on female orgasms which debunked many widespread believes in the society at the time, which also incidentally happen to be one of the driving forces for the sexual revolution that took place in the Western world in 60s and 70s. One of the many difficulties that Masters and Johnson faced was convincing their colleagues and peers that their work was indeed worthy of attention and not pornographic in nature.\nWhen one is confronted with a differences in ideologies in reference to moral superiority, actions, beliefs and information that informs them takes the place that labor has in a capitalist society under a socioeconomic hierarchy. Neither of the players can agree to the other one’s beliefs as that would mean surrendering your perceived moral high ground. In an attempt to not have their beliefs enforced by the moral bourgeoisie, we see an uprising by the oppressed to fight for recognition, which in this example took the form of sexual liberation movement. Here, surplus labor is the ‘extra’ labor that one has to put in, to convince others of their idea. This extra efforts goes into dismantling the other’s dogma and preconceived ill informed notions of your ideas. This surplus labor gives rise to the conflict that we observe, by making an attempt to liberate its subjects, while the oppressors label these actions, beliefs, and information as being rebellious and ‘going against the held values of the society’. We observe this surplus labor in the example of Masters and Johnson in the form of them having to fight against the stigma related to sex and sexuality.\nAnother interesting thing to note is another form that this surplus labor takes which can be seen very apparently in today’s world. The religious majority in an attempt to gain the recognition either rejects modern thoughts and advancements (anti vaccine movement) or instills its dogma more prominently in the society (recognition of alternative medicine by the government of India - formation of AYUSH ministry). Here, the surplus labor goes not into convincing others to take your work seriously, not into destroying the stigma surrounding it, but into dismantling the existing incorrect ideas about objective information, and then educating people with correct information. The surplus labor increases by an order of magnitude!\nAs such we see that the concept of class is imperative to understand the conflict in any social situation, be it socioeconomic conflict or moral superiority. The power of this concept lies not just in its ability to explain conflicts, but also in its abstraction that allows us to extend it from conventional socioeconomic factors to others. Quite counterintuitively, it is the abstraction, a step away from concrete formulation that allows us to explain ideas concretely!\n","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/humanities/exploration-of-morality-as-a-class-conflict/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Exploration of Morality as a Class Conflict","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/psuedoscience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Psuedoscience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sociology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sociology","type":"tags"},{"content":" As I shake in my bed, trembling with not fear, but self loath — I stare at the ceiling.

There’s no light, yet there’s so much to see. Perhaps more to see than light ever allows us to. It is really the lack of the warmth that shows the hearth that the human company is. Being all alone, staring at the ceiling, how many more nights like this ? One more I say to myself, as I drift off in my thoughts — I have plenty of them. Perhaps more than there are stars in this world. Each thought living a life of its own, walking on its own self righteous path. There’s no saying where I am going to go now, but the thought leads the way. It isn’t like I have any control, no, it is all an illusion. My thoughts control me. They control this world. Every moment is a mystery, abundant with possibilities; it’s just a matter of which one I think I am choosing. Is it going to be that paralyzing fear today ? Or am I visiting the Kingdom of Narcissus ? Am I going to drown in the deep ocean of my sorrows, or am I going to conquer the stars ?\nFunny isn’t it ? How the darkness shows us more possibilities than light ever did ? Perhaps some stern cold was we needed in life — the loneliness, the agonizing self hatred, the fire that burns your soul to ashes, the voice of your heart beating echoing through your body — when you experience that, that’s when you know the darkness has gifted its essence to you. What you endure is not even a fraction of horror that it has to offer. Yet with great pain must come great reward. To know that the world is cruel unjust place, where people would care more about what is not in their hands, than you — that understanding is what you are gifted. What a blessing it is! What a wonderful gift it is!\nWhen all the good things begin to hurt you, but the sadness feels like home, that’s how you know the darkness is getting to you. Not to worry, it’s nothing to fear! It is harmless I swear. A few cuts maybe here and there, a few fires burning on my skin — may sound horrible, but it is nothing compared to the flame that burns your heart. You come out stronger in the end. Is what they all say. Did I really come out stronger or the weak ones just didn’t make it through ?\nI think about it a lot. I am quite fond of it actually nowadays. I used to fear it in the beginning, but now — its like a home, a home I never had. One where I am in pain all the time, yet so comfortable that I cannot even move. Petrified by my own brain. By my own thoughts. Somehow tricked into this masochism, eager for more. More pain, more suffering! That is all I wish for. This is my new religion. The darkness has liberated me. Showed me what it is that truly matters.\nI am nobody in this world. I tried going in the light, only to have my heart burn and eyes water. The darkness is where my home lies. It is time I accept it. It is time I fly into the night, embracing it for what it really is — the beautiful monstrous sadistic creature, a brainchild of mine. Oh, what a parent would I be, if I didn’t love a child of mine ? It has spawned from me. I like to think it consumed me, but perhaps, I consumed this world. I infected it with this disease. No, not a disease, a blessing — true enlightenment only comes via the path of suffering. Which raises the question, is it really worth it ?\nThe darkness demands that you believe so. I demand that I believe so. For I have become this darkness. I am no longer its essence but it of mine. Will it always be this cold in here ? Or will the hearth of some company bring me some warmth ? What a blasphemous thought! How could it be ? I am superior, the one true sufferer. I belong with no one. No, no one belongs with me. For them to think they understand the sacred words of this darkness ? Laughable. Utterly hilarious. You do not understand anything, you think you see the world, but you do so by shining your light — if you want to see the world for what it really is, join me, join me in the dark, far from the warmth and the sun, sacrifice your heart, your soul, make your mind a part of mine. We are one, we are the One. The true sufferers, agonized by every breath we take.\nHow foolish of me to offer you such solitude! You could never appreciate it. You do not deserve it. Me ? I do. For reasons that I am unaware. I am the sole bearer of the truth of this world. The real darkness — it is only visible to me. I am the priest, I am the follower, I am the God, I am the blasphemer. It is just me. No one else. Just me and my essence — the darkness.\n","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/literature/sight_without_light/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Sight Without Light","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Srinidhi Kabra's Homepage","summary":"","title":"Contact Me","type":"page"},{"content":" Research Interests # My main research interests are the intersection(s) of algebra, geometry and mathematical physics.

An increase in students’ mathematical maturity and problem solving skills was observed. Designed assignment sheets to complement lectures, facilitating the learning processes and identifying the weaknesses of the students. They were used to identify the weaknesses of the students. Assignments also encouraged creative thinking and out-of-the-box approaches to problem solving.\nFreelance Math Tutor (Feb 2025 - May 2025) Collaborated with the student to design a learning path optimal for their goals and development. Prioritized motivation of concepts and derivations of formulas during lectures to aid the process of critical thinking and eliminate a reliance on rote learning. By the end of the three month duration, once the foundations were solidified; the student was able to grasp concepts on their own and as such no longer required additional support when studying mathematics. Observed an increase in student\u0026rsquo;s test scores and confidence in their mathematical abilities.\nIndepedent Reading Projects # Textbooks marked with * indicate that it is still in progress.\nParticle Physics\nLie Algebras in Particle Physics by Howard Georgi * Symmetries and Group Theory in Particle Physics by Costa, Fogli * Analysis and Topology\nPrinciples of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin Topology by Munkres * Topology of Metric Spaces by Kumaresan Algebra \u0026amp; Representation Theory\nRepresentation Theory of Finite Groups by Steinberg Introduction to Representation Theory by Etingof * Algebra by Artin Linear Algebra by Hoffman, Kunze Multilinear Algebra by Werner Greub * Certifications and Awards # Cleared Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (2021) Received a Gold Medal in the Homi Bhabha Young Scientist Competition held for high school students (2019) Informal Talks / Presentations # Quantum Groups and Construction of Noncommutative Spacetimes, IISER Mohali, India (Scheduled for 1st Nov, 2025) An Informal Introduction to Quantum Groups, IISER Mohali, India (17 Aug, 2025) (Online) (YouTube Link) Skills # Computational Skills : Comfortable doing data analysis on Python and using pandas, numpy, scipy and matplolib libraries Typesetting Skills : Well versed in writing long documents as well as presentations using \\( \\LaTeX \\) Expository Skills : Have significant experience in mathematical exposition including tutoring and mentoring fellow peers and juniors.

I have created these notes with both exposition and completeness in mind - the goal was to express the content I have learned in a manner that aids self study without sacrificing rigor. Motivation is explicitly spelled out. In other words, as a person who values not just mastery over content, but understanding the process of thinking itself; I have explained the content in a pedagogic manner through which I would have preferred to learn it, combining philosophy, motivation and rigor.\nThe notes are relatively self-contained, with relevant prerequisites being mentioned. It is only recently that I have started digitising my notes as such many are incomplete. I hope to finish them as time permits. Considering this, I have only attached the notes that are complete and marked the ones that are yet to be added. As the material is compiled from multiple sources, I have tried to include a complete bibliography.\nNotes will be added soon!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/","section":"Notes","summary":"","title":"Notes","type":"notes"}]
