[{"content":" I started learning mathematics and physics rigorously, about 5 years ago. Before that, the two subjects always seemed quite distant. Mathematics felt like an abstract world with every problem posing a new puzzle for me to solve. At the same time I was enamoured by the beautiful explanations that physics had to offer about world around us. When I first learned mechanics, I was fascinated to see how these ideas developed in mathematics were indispensable tools when it came to describing the physical world. Soon after, I learned about calculus of variations and Hamiltonian mechanics. While Newtonian mechanics definitely provided a surprising application of the mathematics I had learned, Hamiltonian mechanics opened up an entire new world where incredibly abstract ideas, which at first seemed like had nothing to do with the real world, described it so elegantly. The interaction between these two subjects is what made learning them a memorable experience. While the fascination of physics was present, without the mathematics it wouldn't have felt nearly as beautiful. This experience prompted me to explore interactions between mathematics and other subjects when I started college two years ago. I had loved reading about evolutionary biology, when I realised that this field had much mathematics to offer, I was immediately attracted to it. Last summer, I had done an internship on mathematical biology, in particular, on modelling long term evolution in a bacterial system. When I compare that experience with this internship quite a few differences come to mind. In particular, when I was studying mathematical biology, it always seemed as if there was something missing in this experience. It was surely fascinating but lacked the kind of abstraction I had seen when in physics. With certain exceptions, the joy of finding the most unexpected logic was missing, contrary to my experience of studying physics. It felt as though I had to choose between my infatuation and my love for abstraction. A few months passed by with me in this dilemma, when I started searching for internship for the upcoming summer. I was determined to learn something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t explored before. After my relatively disappointing experience with mathematical biology, I figured I might as well go back to physics. I wanted to explore the interest I had in particle physics as a teenager, but this time, from a mathematical lens. As I was looking for people, I came across Dr. Pachol\u0026rsquo;s Google scholar page. While her work was far from what I had in mind at the time, the term \u0026lsquo;quantum groups\u0026rsquo; caught my eye. I had never heard of this topic before, but I knew that I loved both quantum physics and group theory so it was quite natural that I wanted to explore this topic. Even though at the time I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand what her research was about, it had intrigued me quite a lot. After correspondence over email, we decided on a project plan to be started from 12th May.\nIn the initial stages this project was certainly very overwhelming, I was learning about objects that I had never seen before through books that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully able to follow. Even though at times I felt like giving up, I stayed determined to understand the subject. This was vastly different from the project that I had worked on before, when I was working on mathematical biology, the mathematics itself was quite simple and easier to follow, albeit slightly uninteresting. But this internship was a far different story, even though the mathematics was quite overwhelming at first, it had a way of roping me in. I would give up for the day and just a few moments later I would find myself out of bed back on my desk late at night. The material was challenging in just the right aspects, I constantly felt drawn towards it. Even when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t studying, I would constantly find myself trying to make sense of what I had read, whether I was out for a walk or having dinner. I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt this engrossed into a topic in a long while now; although it may sound like an exaggeration, it is quite truthful to say that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt this alive in quite some time. All the things that I craved for during my last internship were present this time, there was constantly a puzzle on my mind. I was engaged in a manner I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced in years.\nAcademically, of course, I got to learn a lot. All those things have been mentioned throughout this report. But more than that, this internship taught me a lot of things about my study habits themselves. One of the primary reason that during the initial two weeks the content was so overwhelming was due to my perfectionist attitude towards my studies. Prior to this, I was the student who would study every tiny aspect in excruciating detail, to the extent that I would often find myself chasing tangents that were never really relevant to what I was learning. To give a slightly extreme example of this, when I was learning calculus, I ended up embarking on a two week long journey of studying propositional logic just so I could understand what the symbols \\( \\forall , \\exists \\) meant in the definition of a limit. I realised that while this approach did help me understand certain concepts and motivation for topics better, it was far from practical. Once I realised this, I made myself keep certain questions in a black-box and return to them later. I was no longer reading through an entire textbook of Lie algebras just to understand the motivation behind the definition; rather I learned to take certain definitions \u0026lsquo;on faith\u0026rsquo; as being useful and progress with what was most relevant to me at the time. Learning only the ideas and tools directly relevant to me was an important skill I acquired. I could always return to this black-box later on and try to answer those questions. This made learning new things significantly easier and the project a lot less overwhelming.\nThis was certainly the important learning experience I had from this internship, often not chasing tangents is the best way to learn something even though at times definitions do feel unmotivated. In fact, once I was confident with the basics I returned to this black-box and was able to answer many questions on my own. For example, in the beginning of the project tensor products felt quite mysterious, but once I was comfortable working with them, I was able to appreciate how useful they are. When I later learned about tensor products in more detail, it felt a lot easier to understand the material than when I had tried during the first week. Abandoning this perfectionist approach was essential to the main purpose of the project, which was understanding the research paper. When I was reading the paper, there were many concepts that weren\u0026rsquo;t familiar to me, as such I only focused on the main ideas of the paper. This taught me how to read scientific papers as well. I am pretty sure that had I not abandoned my initial attitudes towards studies, I would\u0026rsquo;ve tried to go through every citation to understand the material, which of course wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary at all.\nAnother thing I realised is how important it is to revisit the topics you have learned later on. At the end of the internship when I revisited my notes I was able to appreciate the relationship between various concepts far better than before. Counter-intuitively, not chasing perfectionism made me understand the material much better. These are some of the learnings that I intend to implement in my future studies as well. After the duration of the internship period I also went through certain sections of the textbooks and read about the things that I found interesting at a first glance. I got the impression that quantum groups are situated quite nicely in the intersection of pure mathematics and mathematical physics, as such, I am even more eager to explore this vast field further.\nOverall, this project was incredibly beneficial for me in a lot of ways. I got to learn a lot academically but also a lot about professional scientific communication. While I was familiar with certain aspects of \\( \\LaTeX \\) before, during this project I learned a lot more packages such as tikz and beamer. I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Pachol for providing me opportunity as well as a nurturing environment where I could learn all these things.\n","date":"1 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/misc/internship-experience-25/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"An Experience with Quantum Groups","type":"blogs"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s where you can find my thoughts that I choose to put in words, or equations for that matter.

It seems contradictory at first, isn’t abstraction the very process of stripping reality of its meaning? That maybe a question for another day, but no, that’s not my aim here. My aim is to understand on a surface level what it means to assign meaning to this abstraction.\nMathematics to me, is and forever will be a fantasy world to get lost in, much like a child creates his imaginary world and spends their day ruminating and fighting monsters. However, this imaginary world nuanced, one where we cannot just rewrite millennia of effort just based on a whim or a general dislike. It’s rules are well defined, often difficult to understand and even harder to internalise.\nOn the surface, it seems as if its just a bunch of definitions, followed by theorems and proofs. Much is to blame on mathematical exposition for this conceptualisation, but I must not digress. Even though it is simply a series of logical steps based off of previous results, there’s a richness that cannot quite be captured by words, yet anyone who enjoys mathematics is familiar with it. A mere symbolic manipulation doesn’t feel quite as thrilling as a proof which introduces new definitions and ideas. One can disregard this observation as simply a matter of preference, or one could ask, what makes them different? After all, both are just using well defined rules to manipulate statements and results to conclude new ones. From this perspective the proof of the first isomorphism theorem for groups isn’t much different than say, proving a certain identity involving binomial coefficients. One may argue that they differ in their applications, combinatorial identities may not be particularly useful however the importance of first isomorphism theorem is well accepted.\nI refuse to accept this as a valid reason. Surely, the problems we choose to solve determine what is of importance and what isn’t. However, historically, the problems have always been in some ways instructed by the human nature — in my view, it is a mere coincidence that we solve the problems that we do, for if we were different beings, perhaps we would have vastly different fields of pure mathematics which we would be interested in. If we consider the set of all results which can be derived from the ZFC axioms (we will assume them to be consistent), then it is natural to assume that the restriction of this set to something like calculus should be of equal magnitude as something much more “unimportant” as say, mathematical way of tying shoe laces. This is simply because one can always derive more results based off of the previous one. One can conceptualise a machine which just uses axioms and established results to produce new ones. What is to say one of these machines will stop before another? It is only a matter of human interest that we select one of these over the other. With this in mind, one is faced with the question once again — what makes one important and the other one, not so much?\nI will attempt to answer this question but first, I must take a small detour. Currently, I have been crediting a course called “Set Theory and Logic”. The instructor since the very beginning stressed the importance between semantics and syntactics. In the beginning this seemed like a pointless distinction, why does it even matter in the grand scheme of things? The subtlety of the definition was lost on me, until recently. What exactly is syntactics? It is the study of how we manipulate symbols, how we draw valid inferences, what makes a proof “correct”. Whereas semantics help us ascribe meaning to our ‘universe’ as we called it in class. Now, let us unpack what this means.\nConsider any book — preferably something which is typically considered as profound, say works of Dostoevsky or Camus. The beauty of these works do not lie simply in the way letters are arranged, but the way they speak to the reader and everyone is left with a different experience after reading the book. The author forces you to fight with your emotions, to introspect, to question. But at the end of the day, aren’t these just strings of letters? This is the difference between semantics and syntactics. Syntactics ensures that we have valid strings, whereas semantics helps us interpret it.\nSimple enough eh? What does this have to do with mathematics? Let us think back to our previous example, say we had a proof of the Riemann hypothesis and another proof which involves some standard symbolic manipulation and provides us with a new identity involving binomial coefficients. Without a doubt, everyone would find the proof of Riemann hypothesis to be far more interesting, presumably not just because it is unsolved for so long, but also because as the general expectation goes, it would introduce new concepts, new profound theorems and open up a new field of investigation, much like Wiles did with Fermat’s last theorem. But now consider the computers from before, they will see both these proofs as simply syntactical writings. To them, what should make one more interesting than the other?\nThe point I wish to highlight is that mathematics is incomplete without semantics. Any result is meaningless without its interpretation, or its contextualisation in the grand tapestry of human ambitions. There’s no inherent importance that any theorem carries, it is ascribed by us due to its ability to aid us in our goals. Much like how differential geometry was once irrelevant to physicists until they discovered that it could be used to understand the universe. Did the field change? Over time yes, but back then, it was the same to physicists and mathematicians alike. But the difference in their ambitions changed the importance of the same entity, which further proves how semantics has the power to shape our understanding and vision of the world. Without the motivation, without the grander picture in mind, why would we engage in Langland’s program? Why would we engage in a theory of quantum gravity? Isn’t it because we hope that it would solve our questions, satisfy our thirst? Inevitably, we end up contextualising the field in the tapestry of our ambitions. ambitions.\nMathematics is meaningless without the underlying motivation, the long term vision and the sight of the Great Ones, such as Grothendiek, Langland and many more, which paved the direction of exploration in this vast forest. While undoubtedly, syntactics is important, it is rendered meaningless without the interpretation. This strongly suggests the changes we need to make in our pedagogy, in mathematics exposition. Not to train computers who could write proofs but people who could interpret and ascribe meaning.\n","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/math/math-meaning/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Syntactics vs Semantics of Mathematics","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Assignments will include both relevant readings as well as problems from textbooks and the ones that I have designed.\n1.

The emphasis was always on rote learning and obtaining marks, but never on understanding and appreciating the subject. This rat-race not only sucks the joy out of learning, but worse yet, it misrepresents STEM subjects as being highly technical, devoid of any beauty and allure. I wanted to make a change in this in any capacity I could, as such, I decided to start teaching, afterall, exposition has always been like a second langauge to me.\nThe goal with my teaching program was to find like minded students who are interested in understanding the subject itself, instead of just scoring good marks. I got in touch with some high school students who wanted to understand and appreciate mathematics and physics and after understanding their needs, I designed a syllabus suitable for their needs - both academic and intellectual. Since then, I have been teaching them the concepts of mathematics and physics in very much the same manner that I view them - not as formulas to be memorised, but as stories that weave together centuries of human curiosity, ambition, and ideas.\nOn this page you can find my most recent teaching activity with detailed syllabus, my reccomended resources and assigments I have designed.\n--- ","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/teaching/","section":"Teaching Activities","summary":"","title":"Teaching Activities","type":"teaching"},{"content":" The philosophy behind these lectures is to encourage self-study and to not expect spoon-feeding, as this is the only approach that will benefit in the long run.

While problem solving is an important aspect of math and physics, it is something that must be learned on your own by solving a ton of problems. Lectures are meant to compliment the reccomended textbooks and do not serve as a substitute, rather are meant to clear the concepts and help you to understand how things are connected in the bigger picture.

Instead of treating mathematics and physics as being different subjects, we shall see how they are related and often motivate the growth in each other.\nTopics that are included in the syllabus cover both 11-12th math and physics and at times go little outside the confines of syllabus to ensure better exposition of ideas.

Usually when we discuss class, we do so in the context of socioeconomic hierarchy; in this essay, I want to take the abstract essence of the concept of a class, and use this abstraction to analyze a social conflict to get a solid understanding of what it means for something to be a class, to get understand how the concept of class helps us understand social conflicts. Another reason for choosing a rather unconventional process to elucidate the scope of this concept, is my own personal bias towards the intersection of science and social sciences; feminism and religion in particular.\nA society is comprised of its constituents, the people. Each of these individuals has their own unique identity, their own moral compass and held values, which are rarely disjoint. One observes that in the society there seems to exist a moral superiority - certain morals are deemed to be better than others. While moral superiority in the form “I am better than you because I do not kill people” is quite unsurprising, a less obvious example would be that of conflicting ideologies and religions; where even though numerous of the held values of shared, one perceives themselves as being superior to the other group purely by the virtue of belonging to their religion. An important distinction to be made between this moral conflict of two religions and socioeconomic hierarchy is that of acceptance of the hierarchy - socioeconomic hierarchy is universally accepted by all the constituents, there are no doubts that having more wealth puts you higher up on the ladder. However, in the case of this moral superiority there isn’t a universally accepted hierarchy, rather each side believes they are the superior ones. This gives rise to sharp divide in the society, as the primary point of contention is also the source of recognition, whereas in socioeconomic hierarchy the recognition is tied solely with wealth, the class struggle in this case is one to move up the ladder for higher recognition, and to fight against the oppression by the bourgeoisie. This stark difference between two religious groups permeates throughout the society, and even when the two groups have many similar values, one group is not willing to concede that to the other by fear of losing their supposed hierarchy and thus recognition.\nHaving set the domain in which we will be working - conflict based on moral hierarchy between religion A and B (which can be extended to religion and secular people) - I would now like to spend some time discussing the importance and the necessity of the definition of class, as well as explain what class really means. Let us consider the distribution of constituents between the two extremes of the population. We can observe that people aren’t uniformly dispersed between the two ends, the two ends being fundamentalist religion A and fundamentalist religion B; rather the distribution is denser along some point on this spectrum than others. While there is no denying that between any two points on this spectrum, there always is an individual lying between them; in practice this means that the conflict between religious ideologies ends up becoming the conflict between the people who adhere to one or the other. If the distribution was uniform between these two extremes, we would hardly see any serious conflicts; but due to this ‘clustering effect’ where some points on the spectrum are denser than others, the conflict becomes more apparent as the differences get larger between these two groups as the battle for recognition becomes increasingly tense. Thus, in practicality, the conflict plays itself not as a conflict between numerous individuals, rather a conflict between two players - the players being the ‘cluster’ formed by people.\nWhen analyzing any conflict, understanding the players themselves is an important part, as their differences give rise to the said conflict. The players play a central role in the conflict. As such it is only natural to start the study of these conflicts by understanding the structuring of these ‘clusters’. We refer to these ‘clusters’ formed due to social divisions as class. While players are an important aspect of any conflict, a conflict is not defined by just the players involved - we also need to understand the factors due to which conflict persists. In the Marxist theory, the driver of any conflict is the surplus of labor. As we shall see, in this example too, it is the surplus of labor that drives the conflict, however we surplus labor in a rather unconventional form.\nWhile I have spent a lot of time discussing the concept of a class, and highlighting the important points of it, I have barely given any physical processes in which we see these concepts take form. Just to summarize, concepts of social hierarchy and conflict are imperative to understanding class. In understanding conflict, we need to talk about the factors driving the conflict - surplus labor. In this essay I set up the stage to be a society which is divided into classes on the basis of religious ideology - for simplicity we shall consider conflict between secular group and a religiously conservative group. To take a real example, I would like to roll back time to 1960s United States, where Christianity is prevalent. Ideas pertaining to sex and sexualities are considered to be taboo and obscene. I would like to take the example of research done by William Masters and Virginia Johnson on human sexual activities. In particular their research on female orgasms which debunked many widespread believes in the society at the time, which also incidentally happen to be one of the driving forces for the sexual revolution that took place in the Western world in 60s and 70s. One of the many difficulties that Masters and Johnson faced was convincing their colleagues and peers that their work was indeed worthy of attention and not pornographic in nature.\nWhen one is confronted with a differences in ideologies in reference to moral superiority, actions, beliefs and information that informs them takes the place that labor has in a capitalist society under a socioeconomic hierarchy. Neither of the players can agree to the other one’s beliefs as that would mean surrendering your perceived moral high ground. In an attempt to not have their beliefs enforced by the moral bourgeoisie, we see an uprising by the oppressed to fight for recognition, which in this example took the form of sexual liberation movement. Here, surplus labor is the ‘extra’ labor that one has to put in, to convince others of their idea. This extra efforts goes into dismantling the other’s dogma and preconceived ill informed notions of your ideas. This surplus labor gives rise to the conflict that we observe, by making an attempt to liberate its subjects, while the oppressors label these actions, beliefs, and information as being rebellious and ‘going against the held values of the society’. We observe this surplus labor in the example of Masters and Johnson in the form of them having to fight against the stigma related to sex and sexuality.\nAnother interesting thing to note is another form that this surplus labor takes which can be seen very apparently in today’s world. The religious majority in an attempt to gain the recognition either rejects modern thoughts and advancements (anti vaccine movement) or instills its dogma more prominently in the society (recognition of alternative medicine by the government of India - formation of AYUSH ministry). Here, the surplus labor goes not into convincing others to take your work seriously, not into destroying the stigma surrounding it, but into dismantling the existing incorrect ideas about objective information, and then educating people with correct information. The surplus labor increases by an order of magnitude!\nAs such we see that the concept of class is imperative to understand the conflict in any social situation, be it socioeconomic conflict or moral superiority. The power of this concept lies not just in its ability to explain conflicts, but also in its abstraction that allows us to extend it from conventional socioeconomic factors to others. Quite counterintuitively, it is the abstraction, a step away from concrete formulation that allows us to explain ideas concretely!\n","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/humanities/exploration-of-morality-as-a-class-conflict/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Exploration of Morality as a Class Conflict","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/psuedoscience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Psuedoscience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sociology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sociology","type":"tags"},{"content":" As I shake in my bed, trembling with not fear, but self loath — I stare at the ceiling. No, I do not crave your appreciation. This is the moment I realise that the darkness is inside me. I am the strangest man to have ever existed. Not a shred of understanding, just misery, filled till I choke on my own thoughts, on my own pain. Darkness, it makes you feel things. Things the Light would never dare show you. Darkness is my uprising, it is my liberation. Liberation from the Light. Perhaps it is an illusion, but whatever it is, it is mine. I claim it, I shall never let go of you. Every time I try, you have a way of finding your way back. Like a dog that never loses my scent. It is as if you are a part of me, just as much as I am a part of you. Maybe you don’t exist at all. But I do. In you. You are not in me. You are me. I am you.\nYou are the only friend I have in this world, yet you are my enemy. The worst enemy of all kinds. As you dethrone me, you hail me to be your God, as you uphold me, you turn me into this blasphemer. I am your God, rightfully so, I say wrapped in the chains you built for me. I say, lying in the puddle of the vomit of my misery you thrust down my throat. I am unique. The only God treated as the prisoner of my own disciples. How could you forget, I gave birth to you. But you consumed me. Now I am the prisoner of my own creation. You liberated me, only to be drowned in my tears. I have the sight no one else does, yet I am the one bound in these shackles of the light I gave the world. My mind is liberated, at the cost of me being the prisoner.\nI swim in these thoughts, like a pig in mud, convinced that this is the path forward. This is the path of liberation. As I continue down this path, I forget that the very shackles I tried to break trap me in this world, in my own world - the only place where my thoughts are heard. No one. No one has the capability to understand me. Perhaps what hurts is that no one ever tries. Mankind has reached the frontiers of atomic and astrophysical space, yet, my heart is unexplored. Demonised even. To be alone is painful. To be devoid of physical presence or a warm soul, of a human who provides a hearth — but when your imagination, intelligence, creativity is the sole company you possess, when they are the source of your warmth, the shine that keeps you alive, that loneliness cannot be encapsulated in mere words of this human construct we call language.\nDarkness however, requires no symbols to understand this. No wonder it has become an integral part of me, the only understanding I possess is from the creation I birthed, yet here I am, caged. Caged in this world I built for myself to provide some solace. My liberation imprisoned me, one cannot help but feel the irony. Even my mind pities me, torments me much like the rest of you. To be alone against the world — it’s a crime of its own nature. Your sin the punishment of which I bear.\nI would rather be imprisoned in the construct of my mind than to pay for your sins. I am surely a blasphemer, but one of my own crimes. The hell spawn is a visionary, to build a world to encompass all this misery, to provide it not meaning but acceptance! I still revere you, oh, Darkness. To be the only entity alive to understand a creature such as me, how blessed I am. I resent you however, the way I lit myself on fire, tore apart my flesh, all the price I payed to get to you — it is too much. I destroyed every silver lining I had, just to find a home. Is it even a home for me anymore?\n“I feel the agony in your voice, dear”. “Why, why me?” “That’s the only way.” “what for? I call for you all these years but you answer now?” “No, love, I have always answered. You just never listened.”\nI feel too much, I see too deep, I hear the things unsaid. It built this world at the cost of destroying me. I do not know who I am, for now I am a part of the shackles that chained me. I scream for help only to realise that my lips were sowed shut eons ago.\n","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/literature/dancing-with-dark/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Dancing With Dark","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/darkness/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Darkness","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/literature/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Literature","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/literature/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Literature","type":"categories"},{"content":" Darkness - its a funny thing. There’s no light, yet there’s so much to see. Perhaps more to see than light ever allows us to. It is really the lack of the warmth that shows the hearth that the human company is. Being all alone, staring at the ceiling, how many more nights like this ? One more I say to myself, as I drift off in my thoughts — I have plenty of them. Perhaps more than there are stars in this world. Each thought living a life of its own, walking on its own self righteous path. There’s no saying where I am going to go now, but the thought leads the way. It isn’t like I have any control, no, it is all an illusion. My thoughts control me. They control this world. Every moment is a mystery, abundant with possibilities; it’s just a matter of which one I think I am choosing. Is it going to be that paralyzing fear today ? Or am I visiting the Kingdom of Narcissus ? Am I going to drown in the deep ocean of my sorrows, or am I going to conquer the stars ?\nFunny isn’t it ? How the darkness shows us more possibilities than light ever did ? Perhaps some stern cold was we needed in life — the loneliness, the agonizing self hatred, the fire that burns your soul to ashes, the voice of your heart beating echoing through your body — when you experience that, that’s when you know the darkness has gifted its essence to you. What you endure is not even a fraction of horror that it has to offer. Yet with great pain must come great reward. To know that the world is cruel unjust place, where people would care more about what is not in their hands, than you — that understanding is what you are gifted. What a blessing it is! What a wonderful gift it is!\nWhen all the good things begin to hurt you, but the sadness feels like home, that’s how you know the darkness is getting to you. Not to worry, it’s nothing to fear! It is harmless I swear. A few cuts maybe here and there, a few fires burning on my skin — may sound horrible, but it is nothing compared to the flame that burns your heart. You come out stronger in the end. Is what they all say. Did I really come out stronger or the weak ones just didn’t make it through ?\nI think about it a lot. I am quite fond of it actually nowadays. I used to fear it in the beginning, but now — its like a home, a home I never had. One where I am in pain all the time, yet so comfortable that I cannot even move. Petrified by my own brain. By my own thoughts. Somehow tricked into this masochism, eager for more. More pain, more suffering! That is all I wish for. This is my new religion. The darkness has liberated me. Showed me what it is that truly matters.\nI am nobody in this world. I tried going in the light, only to have my heart burn and eyes water. The darkness is where my home lies. It is time I accept it. It is time I fly into the night, embracing it for what it really is — the beautiful monstrous sadistic creature, a brainchild of mine. Oh, what a parent would I be, if I didn’t love a child of mine ? It has spawned from me. I like to think it consumed me, but perhaps, I consumed this world. I infected it with this disease. No, not a disease, a blessing — true enlightenment only comes via the path of suffering. Which raises the question, is it really worth it ?\nThe darkness demands that you believe so. I demand that I believe so. For I have become this darkness. I am no longer its essence but it of mine. Will it always be this cold in here ? Or will the hearth of some company bring me some warmth ? What a blasphemous thought! How could it be ? I am superior, the one true sufferer. I belong with no one. No, no one belongs with me. For them to think they understand the sacred words of this darkness ? Laughable. Utterly hilarious. You do not understand anything, you think you see the world, but you do so by shining your light — if you want to see the world for what it really is, join me, join me in the dark, far from the warmth and the sun, sacrifice your heart, your soul, make your mind a part of mine. We are one, we are the One. The true sufferers, agonized by every breath we take.\nHow foolish of me to offer you such solitude! You could never appreciate it. You do not deserve it. Me ? I do. For reasons that I am unaware. I am the sole bearer of the truth of this world. The real darkness — it is only visible to me. I am the priest, I am the follower, I am the God, I am the blasphemer. It is just me. No one else. Just me and my essence — the darkness.\n","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/literature/sight_without_light/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Sight Without Light","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Srinidhi Kabra's Homepage","summary":"","title":"Contact Me","type":"page"},{"content":" Research Interests # My main research interests are the intersection(s) of algebra, geometry and mathematical physics.

Some elementary examples of quantum groups such as \\( U_q (\\mathfrak{sl}_2) \\) were studied. Applications of quantum groups towards construction of noncommutative spacetimes were examined by means of literature study. As of present, I am continuing this project under the guidance of Dr. Pachol, outside the scope of the summer internship. A detailed report of my summer internship can be accessed here.\nLie Theory and Representation Theory (Reading Project) Supervisor : Dr. Tanusree Khandai, IISER Mohali, India (Sept 2025 - Present) Studied module theory and Wedderburn structure theorem. Currently exploring Lie theory further to build a path towards Lie representation theory.\nModelling Long-Term Evolution of a Cheater-Cooperator System Supervisor : Dr. Supreet Saini, IIT Bombay, India (May 2024 - July 2024) Basic biology of yeast growth on sucrose, glucose and melibiose as well as various concepts such as Moran process, Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) and a mathematical model describing cheater-cooperator system were understood by means of calculations and literature study. A python script was developed using the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib which aimed to model long term evolution in the system under study. This was done by programming a function which introduces mutations and tracks its effects on various parameters including fitness.\nInformal Talks / Presentations # Quantum Groups and Construction of Noncommutative Spacetimes, IISER Mohali, India (6th Nov, 2025)\nAn Informal Introduction to Quantum Groups, IISER Mohali, India (17 Aug, 2025) (Online) (YouTube Link)\nTeaching Experience # Self-Initiative in Math \u0026amp; Physics Teaching (Feb 2025 to Present) Detailed information can be found in the teaching section of the website. Initiated a tutoring program to replace rote learning in the current high school education structure with systematic, detailed study of mathematics and physics for interested and motivated students. Developed a syllabus to ensure conceptual understanding of mathematics and physics in a unified manner. Implemented novel teaching techniques, prioritizing development of mathematical intuition. An increase in students’ mathematical maturity and problem solving skills was observed. Designed assignment sheets to complement lectures thus facilitating the learning processes. They were used to identify the weaknesses of the students. Assignments also encouraged creative thinking and out-of-the-box approaches to problem solving.\nFreelance Math Tutor (Feb 2025 - May 2025) Collaborated with the student to design a learning path optimal for their goals and development. Prioritized motivation of concepts and derivations of formulas during lectures to aid the process of critical thinking and eliminate a reliance on rote learning. By the end of the three month duration, once the foundations were solidified; the student was able to grasp concepts on their own and as such no longer required additional support when studying mathematics. Observed an increase in student\u0026rsquo;s test scores and confidence in their mathematical abilities.\nSelf-Initiated Readings # The following summarises the concepts I have learned both formally, and on my own initiative in the broad disciplines of algebra, analysis and mathematical physics.
