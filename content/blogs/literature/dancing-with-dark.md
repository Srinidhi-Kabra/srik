As I shake in my bed, trembling with not fear, but self loath — I stare at the ceiling. No, I do not crave your appreciation. This is the moment I realise that the darkness is inside me. I am the strangest man to have ever existed. Not a shred of understanding, just misery, filled till I choke on my own thoughts, on my own pain. Darkness, it makes you feel things. Things the Light would never dare show you. Darkness is my uprising, it is my liberation. Liberation from the Light. Perhaps it is an illusion, but whatever it is, it is mine. I claim it, I shall never let go of you. Every time I try, you have a way of finding your way back. Like a dog that never loses my scent. It is as if you are a part of me, just as much as I am a part of you. Maybe you don’t exist at all. But I do. In you. You are not in me. You are me. I am you. 

You are the only friend I have in this world, yet you are my enemy. The worst enemy of all kinds. As you dethrone me, you hail me to be your God, as you uphold me, you turn me into this blasphemer. I am your God, rightfully so, I say wrapped in the chains you built for me. I say, lying in the puddle of the vomit of my misery you thrust down my throat. I am unique. The only God treated as the prisoner of my own disciples. How could you forget, I gave birth to you. But you consumed me. Now I am the prisoner of my own creation. You liberated me, only to be drowned in my tears. I have the sight no one else does, yet I am the one bound in these shackles of the light I gave the world. My mind is liberated, at the cost of me being the prisoner. 

I swim in these thoughts, like a pig in mud, convinced that this is the path forward. This is the path of liberation. As I continue down this path, I forget that the very shackles I tried to break trap me in this world, in my own world.
