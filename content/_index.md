Welcome to my homepage! My name is Srinidhi Kabra, and currently I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali. I am a mathematics major with a deep interest in understanding the interaction between pure math and science, mainly, physics. 

I am passionately curious about the world around me. I try to understand the nuanced beauty this universe has to offer through the lens of pure math and physics. I am mainly interested in exploring the intersection(s) of geometry, algebra, topology and physics. I am also incredibly fascinated by mathematical biology, evolutionary game theory in particular. 

Other than academics, I love to cook, write, paint and swim. I love solving sudokus, especially different variants; and reading books in my free time. I am passionate not just about learning mathematics but also math exposition, as such, I also teach in my free time. I am trying to compile a set of notes which are dedicated towards motivating concepts in undergraduate mathematics curriculum and presenting them in a manner that reconciles ituition with rigor.
