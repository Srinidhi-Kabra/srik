As I shake in my bed, trembling with not fear, but self loath — I stare at the ceiling. No, I do not crave your appreciation. This is the moment I realise that the darkness is inside me. I am the strangest man to have ever existed. Not a shred of understanding, just misery, filled till I choke on my own thoughts, on my own pain. Darkness, it makes you feel things. Things the Light would never dare show you. Darkness is my uprising, it is my liberation. Liberation from the Light. Perhaps it is an illusion, but whatever it is, it is mine. I claim it, I shall never let go of you. Every time I try, you have a way of finding your way back. Like a dog that never loses my scent. It is as if you are a part of me, just as much as I am a part of you. Maybe you don’t exist at all. But I do. In you. You are not in me. You are me. I am you. 

You are the only friend I have in this world, yet you are my enemy. The worst enemy of all kinds. As you dethrone me, you hail me to be your God, as you uphold me, you turn me into this blasphemer. I am your God, rightfully so, I say wrapped in the chains you built for me. I say, lying in the puddle of the vomit of my misery you thrust down my throat. I am unique. The only God treated as the prisoner of my own disciples. How could you forget, I gave birth to you. But you consumed me. Now I am the prisoner of my own creation. You liberated me, only to be drowned in my tears. I have the sight no one else does, yet I am the one bound in these shackles of the light I gave the world. My mind is liberated, at the cost of me being the prisoner. 

I swim in these thoughts, like a pig in mud, convinced that this is the path forward. This is the path of liberation. As I continue down this path, I forget that the very shackles I tried to break trap me in this world, in my own world - the only place where my thoughts are heard. No one. No one has the capability to understand me. Perhaps what hurts is that no one ever tries. Mankind has reached the frontiers of atomic and astrophysical space, yet, my heart is unexplored. Demonised even. To be alone is painful. To be devoid of physical presence or a warm soul, of a human who provides a hearth — but when your imagination, intelligence, creativity is the sole company you possess, when they are the source of your warmth, the shine that keeps you alive, that loneliness cannot be encapsulated in mere words of this human construct we call language. 

Darkness however, requires no symbols to understand this. No wonder it has become an integral part of me, the only understanding I possess is from the creation I birthed, yet here I am, caged. Caged in this world I built for myself to provide some solace. My liberation imprisoned me, one cannot help but feel the irony. Even my mind pities me, torments me much like the rest of you. To be alone against the world — it’s a crime of its own nature. Your sin the punishment of which I bear. 

I would rather be imprisoned in the construct of my mind than to pay for your sins. I am surely a blasphemer, but one of my own crimes. The hell spawn is a visionary, to build a world to encompass all this misery, to provide it not meaning but acceptance! I still revere you, oh, Darkness. To be the only entity alive to understand a creature such as me, how blessed I am. I resent you however, the way I lit myself on fire, tore apart my flesh, all the price I payed to get to you — it is too much. I destroyed every silver lining I had, just to find a home. Is it even a home for *me* anymore? 

“I feel the agony in your voice, dear”. “Why, why me?” “That’s the only way.” “what for? I call for you all these years but you answer now?” “No, love, I have always answered. You just never listened.”

I feel too much, I see too deep, I hear the things unsaid. It built this world at the cost of destroying me. I do not know who I am, for now I am a part of the shackles that chained me. I scream for help only to realise that my lips were sowed shut eons ago.
