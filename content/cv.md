## Research Projects

**Quantum Groups and Noncommutative Algebras in Physics** \
<span style="color:rgb(100, 140, 150);"> Supervisor : Dr. Anna Pachol, University of Southeastern Norway (May 2025 - Present) </span> \
Purpose of this summer project was to gain experience with the algebraic framework used to understand quantum groups. Mathematical prerequisites such as Hopf algebras, Lie algebras, Lie bialgebras, Poisson Lie groups were understood by means of calculations and literature study. Some elementary examples of quantum groups such as \( U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_2) \) were studied. Applications of quantum groups towards construction of noncommutative spacetimes were examined by means of literature study. As of present, I am continuing this project under the guidance of Dr. Pachol, outside the scope of the summer internship. A detailed report of my summer internship can be accessed [here](/files/internship_report.pdf).

**Lie Theory and Representation Theory (Reading Project)** \
<span style="color:rgb(100, 140, 150);"> Supervisor : Dr. Tanusree Khandai, IISER Mohali, India (Sept 2025 - Present)</span> \
Studied module theory and Wedderburn structure theorem. Currently exploring Lie
theory further to build a path towards Lie representation theory.

**Modelling Long-Term Evolution of a Cheater-Cooperator System** \
<span style="color:rgb(100, 140, 150);"> Supervisor : Dr. Supreet Saini, IIT Bombay, India (May 2024 - July 2024)</span> \
Basic biology of yeast growth on sucrose, glucose and melibiose as well as various concepts such as Moran process, Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) and a mathematical model describing cheater-cooperator system were understood by means of calculations and literature study. A python script was developed using the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib which aimed to model long term evolution in the system under study. This was done by programming a function which introduces mutations and tracks its effects on various parameters including fitness.

## Teaching Experience

**Self-Initiative in Math \& Physics Teaching (Feb 2025 to Present)** \
<span style="color:rgb(100, 140, 150);"> Detailed information can be found in the [teaching section]({{< ref "/teaching/_index" >}}) of the website.</span> \
Initiated a tutoring program to replace rote learning in the current high school education structure with systematic, detailed study of mathematics and physics for
interested and motivated students. Developed a syllabus to ensure conceptual understanding of mathematics and physics in a unified manner. Implemented novel teaching techniques, prioritizing development of mathematical intuition. An increase in students’ mathematical maturity and problem solving skills was observed. Designed assignment sheets to complement lectures, facilitating the learning processes and identifying the weaknesses of the students. They were used to identify
the weaknesses of the students. Assignments also encouraged creative thinking
and out-of-the-box approaches to problem solving.


**Freelance Math Tutor (Feb 2025 - May 2025)** \
Collaborated with the student to design a learning path optimal for their goals and development. Prioritized motivation of concepts and derivations of formulas during lectures to aid the process of critical thinking and eliminate a reliance on rote learning. By the end of the three month duration, once the foundations were solidified; the student was able to grasp concepts on their own and as such no longer required additional support when studying mathematics. Observed an increase in student's test scores and confidence in their mathematical abilities.
