Below I have compiled links to the notes that I have taken over the course of last few months. I have created these notes with both exposition and completeness in mind - the goal was to express the content I have learned in a manner that aids self study without sacrificing rigor. Motivation is explicitly spelled out. In other words, as a person who values not just mastery over content, but understanding the process of thinking itself; I have explained the content in a pedagogic manner through which I would have preferred to learn it, combining philosophy, motivation and rigor. 

The notes are relatively self-contained, with relevant prerequisites being mentioned. It is only recently that I have started digitising my notes as such many are incomplete. I hope to finish them as time permits. Considering this, I have only attached the notes that are complete and marked the ones that are yet to be added. As the material is compiled from multiple sources, I have tried to include a complete bibliography.  

*Notes will be added soon!*
